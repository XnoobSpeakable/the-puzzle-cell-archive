Everything that isn't in brackets is the official version of the game (without codename, just version)

UT means "Untampered"
UU means "Unkown if Untampered"
If it has a UT, that means that it's 100% identical to the version that was downloaded. If it has a UU that means I may have played on it and possibly edited some files while messing around. It's MOST LIKELY unmodified, but I can't guarantee that.
P means the version was private (only given out to a few people for testing).

OK means the game works and is the same version as the name of the folder

And finally, the number at the start of the name means how early the version was released. A version with a lower number was released before a version with a bigger number. This is done so sorting by name makes it sort in order from oldest to newest.

Also this isn't all the versions, but you can probably tell by the version numbers.
